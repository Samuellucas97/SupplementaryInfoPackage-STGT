# STGT Research Artifacts

This is the supplementary material for the Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) study named **Walking the Tightrope of LLMs for Software Development: A Practitioners' Perspective**. We performed twenty-two interviews across three rounds of data collection and analysis. 

### Content

* [Pre-interview questionnaire](https://github.com/Samuellucas97/SupplementaryInfoPackage-STGT/blob/main/pre-interview-questionnaire.pdf): It contains the consent form, demographic questions, and experience with LLM tools. 
 
* [Interview Guide](https://github.com/Samuellucas97/SupplementaryInfoPackage-STGT/blob/main/Interview%20Guide.pdf): The interview guide for the semi-structured interviews. The file contains the updates across the rounds. 

* [STGT Example](https://github.com/Samuellucas97/SupplementaryInfoPackage-STGT/blob/main/STGTExample.pdf): It contains examples of applying STGT for data analysis

* [Set of Memos](https://github.com/Samuellucas97/SupplementaryInfoPackage-STGT/blob/main/Memos.pdf): Main memos from the analysis of interviews. 

* [Assumption List](https://github.com/Samuellucas97/SupplementaryInfoPackage-STGT/blob/main/AssumptionList.pdf): Acknowledging researcher bias during data analysis. 

* [LLM Capabilities](https://github.com/Samuellucas97/SupplementaryInfoPackage-STGT/blob/main/LLMsCapabilities.pdf): Representative (not exhaustive) list of LLM capabilities.
